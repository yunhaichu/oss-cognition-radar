# Project State

## Current Goal

Build OSS Cognition Radar: a lightweight tool that studies popular open-source repositories as public engineering evidence, then extracts observable, reviewable, and transferable cognition/design/governance patterns.

## Current Phase

The project has pivoted from a simple GitHub hot-project radar to an evidence-backed project dossier generator. Discovery mode still finds candidate repositories; deep mode analyzes one repository through README, docs/examples files, releases, issues, PRs, and governance artifacts.

## Implemented

- `radar.py`: supports discovery mode and `--repo owner/name` deep analysis mode.
- Deep reports include method boundaries, project dossier fields, fake-star risk, confidence labels, and a traceable evidence chain.
- `README.md`: updated for the new OSS Cognition Radar positioning and usage.
- `.gitignore`: ignores generated reports and local files.

## Known Limits

- No persistent database yet, so star growth still uses `stars / age_days`.
- Evidence extraction is heuristic and limited to a small number of files, releases, issues, and PRs.
- No LLM analysis yet; claims are rule-based and should be treated as first-pass research prompts.
- No per-category scoring yet for agent, developer tools, local-first, and protocol projects.

## Release Policy

Every pushed commit must have a corresponding GitHub Release. Use a commit-addressed tag such as `rYYYYMMDD-<shortsha>` so each release maps unambiguously to one commit.

## Next Local Step

Add SQLite snapshots and JSON dossier export so evidence items, claims, scores, and later manual/LLM review can be preserved and compared across runs.
